# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

**Problem Statement:**<br>

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.<br>
The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score
Have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.<br>
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

**Goals of the Case Study:**

1. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
2. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
